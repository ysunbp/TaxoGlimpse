# TaxoGlimpse

This is the repository for TaxoGlimpse, a benchmark evaluating LLMs' performance on taxonomies.

## 1. Install requirements
In order to deploy the LLMs and install requirements for the data processing scripts, we need to create the following environments: llama (for Llama-2s), vicuna-self (for vicunas), falcon (for falcons), flan-t5 (for flan-t5s), and LLM-probing (for GPTs and data processing).

## 2. Data collection

## 3. LLMs deployment

## 4. Question generation

## 5. Evaluation
