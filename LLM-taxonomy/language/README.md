# How to get the raw language taxonomy data
If you want to use the question pools generated directly, you can skip this page and refer to the page for [question_pools](https://github.com/ysunbp/TaxoGlimpse/tree/main/question_pools) directly!
## Step 1 Download raw data 
Please download the raw language taxonomy data from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1olWvp1Gm9d7Fkz6FOPUsPVZ9nlTTIkqu/view?usp=drive_link).
You can download and unzip these files and put them in the language folder.
## Step 2 Generate question pools
Please follow these steps: <br>
1. Run the [language_generate_question_pool.py](./scripts/language_generate_question_pool.py) file to obtain the question pool for the main experiments.<br>
2. Run the [language_generate_question_pool_instance.py](./scripts/language_generate_question_pool_instance.py) file to obtain the question pool for the instance typing experiments.
